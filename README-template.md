## Overview

This challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The website can't actually do anything, and is just a simple HTML and CSS project.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I recently learned CSS, so this challenge was a good application of principles. I had a little trouble with getting the card to be in the right place, but after a little research, I figured it out.
